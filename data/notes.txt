Note: these datasets are used in R scripts 2 and 3 
For the input of R scripts 1, the output from Roary is too big, so it will be hosted in dropbox. You can download it here: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/8qj9mjslhagh6xsizupeh/AEw8UVQgkHURlqoVLTfEkbs?rlkey=prshrezrarnz3iaoqyqxt9bwl&st=vlmmdmg3&dl=0
